About
-----

I gave a technical talk - an introduction to AngularJS - at my work (PMAT Inc) to the engineering staff on Sep 2013.  The slides were written using a combination of Revealjs (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and Angularjs (http://angularjs.org/).  The angularjs toy examples are legitimate Angularjs code apps.  Each Angular example is an independent app, loaded using bootstrap.
